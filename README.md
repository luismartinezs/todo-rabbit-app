## Dev notes

- Use firebase-cli version 10.9.2 (`pnpm install -g firebase-tools@10.9.2`) otherwise emulator ui breaks (see [node.js - Firebase Emulator fails at startup Cannot find module --dns-result-order=ipv4first - Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/72313155/firebase-emulator-fails-at-startup-cannot-find-module-dns-result-order-ipv4fir))

## Planning

- Auth
  - Everyone can sign in - login, with email and password or with google
  - Firebase auth
  - User can logout
  - Logged out users go to /login page
  - Logged in users go to /
- App
  - User logs in and can view, create, edit and delete todos
  - Todos are stored in firestore
  - Each user has their own todos
  - One user cannot see todos from other users
  - User can toggle todo between done and pending -> no, user simply deletes todo if it's done
  - Changes to todos are synced with firestore

## Dev flow

- Start project locally: `pnpm dev` (or `pnpm emu` in emulator mode)
- Make changes in `dev` branch (or feature branch)
- Push `dev` branch to remote as I work
- Make sure new code works in localhost
- Merge `dev` to `main`
- Deploy to netlify by pushing `main`
